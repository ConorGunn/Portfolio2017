		I am a Creative Digital Media student with nearly 10 years experience in scriptwriting and editing, and two years experience
		in Graphic Design,</br> Sound Design and Web Design.
		</br></br>
		I am trained in Indesign, Illustrator, Preiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Dreamweaver and Photoshop.
		</br></br>
		For six years, I attended the Irish Film Academy and was taught storyboarding, scriptwriting, video editing, directing and camera work.<br>
		In my time there, I created short films, music videos and 30 second adverts. I like to write in my free time. My recent projects include comics,<br> short stories and scripts.
		</br>
		</br>
		I had always had a passion for different creative fields from the short comics I'd make as a kid, to the short films I'd create with my friends. And whilst none of these are particularly good,
		They were useful in how I developed my style and methods through many years of trial and error.
